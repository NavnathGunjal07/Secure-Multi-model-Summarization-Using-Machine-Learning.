A chimpanzee is one of the great apes and the nearest in intelligence to man. Scientists have examined its mental capacities and sent it into space in anticipation of man. Chimpanzees need little description. Being apes and not monkeys, they have no tails. Their arms are longer than their legs and they normally rim on all fours. They can also walk upright with toes turned outwards. When erect they stand 3-5 ft high. The hair is long and coarse, black except for a white patch near the rump. The face, ears, hands and feet are bare and except for the black face, the flesh is coloured.

Chimpanzees exhibit great concern for each other. When chimpanzees meet after having been apart they greet each other in a very human way by touching each other or even clasping hands. Chimpanzees have amazing social discipline. When a dominant male arrives, the rest of the chimpanzees hurry to pay respect to it. The dominant male is not allowed to wrest food from his inferiors. The members of a party also spend considerable amount of time grooming each other and themselves. Mothers go through the fur of their babies for any foreign particles, dirt, and ticks and they aid each other when they are injured.

Chimpanzees are the best tools users apart from man. Sticks 2-3 ft long are picked off the ground orbaalnfnjai branches and pushed into nests, then withdrawn and the honey or insects licked off. Stones are and ttecacfc nuts or as missiles to drive humans and baboons away from its food. Chimpanzees are not only toolunBUthut also toolmakers. They make their own rods by stripping the leaves off a twig or tear shreds off a chimpanzees learn all this by observing the older chimpanzees making and using them. So man is not the easily toolmaker, merely better at it than his relatives.
