1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:10,500
99% of people are not willing to do, what it takes make their dreams come true.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:10,980
 

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,198
The Marines have a saying: "Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die"

4
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:22,000
The center of bringing any dream into fruition is self discipline

5
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:32,000
You know, something as simple as food and eating... it's not about your body as much as it is about your mind.

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:39,600
It's getting command of your mind to be able to choose actions that are in your own best interest.

7
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:46,019
Every day we are choosing shit that's not in our own best interest.

8
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,449
So if the world is attacking you and the world wants to fight you and the world's trying to hold you down.

9
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,270
So you're gonna kick yourself in the balls.

10
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,200
So you will stop yourself from getting what you dream.

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,800
And I think the word "discipline" has kind of gotten a bad name.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,600
We think about it in terms of punishment.

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,700
I'm not talking about discipline in that way.

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:18,399
I'm talking about discipline in the sense that you you forego immediate pleasure

15
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:25,100
for the exchange of long-term self-respect.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,170
I believe that self-discipline is the definition of self-love

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,530
that when you say that you love yourself

18
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,002
that means that you have behavior towards yourself.

19
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:41,800
That is loving

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,908
Self-discipline is the center of all material success.

21
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:54,919
You cannot win the war against the world if you can't win the war against your own mind.

22
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,739
Self-love is when you say to yourself

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,990
Man, look I know you and that girl got a real connection

24
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,250
I know y'all vibe, but

25
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,399
Yes, your girl's cousin. So I love you too much to let you do that

26
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,300
It's like you say to yourself a man look

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,229
I know you want to eat that pizza and it'll be really good, you know, but I can't let you eat that man

28
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,510
cuz if you eat that pizza, you're gonna feel like

29
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,190
You know, and I I just I love you too much to let you eat that

30
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,570
Self-love is a look. I know you got a a test on Monday, you know

31
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,459
and I know you really want to go out with your friends and Saturday night you want to go out but

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,060
If you fail that test, you're not gonna feel good about yourself

33
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,440
You know, I just I love you too much to let you go out tonight

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,380
Self-discipline is

35
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,989
Self-love if you wanna be happy you have to love yourself

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,978
Which means you have to discipline your behavior

37
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,830
the road

38
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,680
Sustained

39
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
happiness is through

40
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,419
Disciplining your behavior. We tend to base our self-esteem

41
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,199
on what other people think and

42
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,549
That's not really

43
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:32,369
Self-esteem self-esteem asposed to be how we feel about ourselves

44
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,539
and I was just saying how dangerous it is to

45
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:44,759
allow other people to determine how you're going to feel about you and it's kind of like

46
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,669
looking into a broken mirror.

47
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:55,229
You're gonna look in a broken mirror and then change your face to try to look good in this defiled busted

48
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,659
broken mirror and

49
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:04,888
it just other people's opinions. There's a really shit way to determine how we feel about

50
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,330
ourselves.

51
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,519
It don't matter whose fault it is that something is broken if it's your responsibility to fix it

52
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,948
For example, it's not somebody's fault if their father was an abusive alcoholic.

53
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,650
But it's for damn sure their responsibility

54
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,688
to figure out how they're gonna do with those traumas and try to make a life out of it

55
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:40,679
It's not your fault if your partner cheated and ruined your marriage

56
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:51,138
But it is for damn sure your responsibility to figure out how to take that pain and how to overcome that and build a happy life for yourself.

57
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:57,135
Fault and responsibility do not go together. It sucks, but they don't.

58
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:59,239
When something is somebody's fault we want them to suffer.

59
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:06,828
We want them punished. We want them to pay. We want it to be their responsibility to fix it

60
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,609
but that's not how it works, especially when it's your heart.

61
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:19,789
Your heart, your life, your happiness is your responsibility and your responsibility alone

62
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:27,099
As long as we're pointing the finger and stuck in whose fault

63
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:33,229
Something is we're jammed and trapped into victim mode when you're in victim mode

64
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,308
You're stuck in suffering the road to power is in taking responsibility

65
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,978
Your heart your life your happiness is your responsibility and your responsibility alone

66
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:53,268
Do you make a person smile you can make a person feel good you can make a person laugh

67
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:57,199
but whether or not a person is happy is

68
00:05:57,809 --> 00:06:00,979
Deeply and totally and utterly out of your control

69
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:10,249
The prerequisite for spending time with any person is that they nourish and inspire you

70
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,187
They feed your flame. Look at your last five text messages.

71
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:20,400
Are those people feeding your flames or dousing your fire?

72
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,629
Put your phone down for just a second and look around

73
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,719
Look to the people around you

74
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,949
Are those people throwing logs on your fire or they pissing on it?

75
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:47,118
I want my life, I want my work, my family.

76
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:57,100
I wanted to mean something and it's like it has if you are not making someone else's life better than you're wasting your time.

77
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:08,600
The separation of talent and skill is one of the the the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel who have dreams that want to do things.

78
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:15,109
Talent you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft.

79
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,860
You don't try to build a wall

80
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:27,099
You don't set out to build a wall. You don't say I'm the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that's ever been built.

81
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:35,599
You don't start there. You say I'm gonna lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid.

82
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:41,500
There will not be one brick on the face of the earth that's gonna be lay better than this brick; that I'm gonna lay in this next 10 minutes.

83
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,389
And you do that every single day.

84
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,989
And soon you have a wall and I think psychologically

85
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,539
the advantage that that gives me over over a lot of people that I

86
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,379
have been in competition with in different situations is

87
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,039
it's difficult to take the first step when you look how big

88
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,740
the task

89
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,039
The definition of Who I am is very clear to me and it also

90
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,698
redefines who I want to be

91
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,460
in that I

92
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
know for a fact that

93
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:31,290
I'm stronger than I thought I was you know, you can't help but ask yourself the question. What would I do if I was in?

94
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,169
Mohammed Eileen shoes

95
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,549
I'm motivated by fear. I

96
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
hate

97
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,030
Scared abuse on

98
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
And I think what developed

99
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,400
Was the the attitude that I started attacking things

100
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,160
I was scared

101
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,579
Why were you scared in your bed the night before?

102
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,169
Why did you what do you need that fear for just don't go?

103
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,858
Why are you scared in your bed 16 hours before you jump? Why are you scared in the car?

104
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,499
Why could you not enjoy breakfast?

105
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,399
fear is

106
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:23,169
Fear of what you're nowhere near the airplane if we think up to the stepping out

107
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,390
There's actually no reason to be scared. It only just ruins your day

108
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:36,400
You're you don't have to jump and then in that moment all of a sudden where you should be terrified is the most blissful

109
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:44,340
Experience of your life and God place the best things in life on the other side of terror
