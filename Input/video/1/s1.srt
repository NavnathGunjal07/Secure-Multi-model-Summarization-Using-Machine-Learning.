1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,530
I'm here to talk about success right

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,530
[Applause]

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:16,359
[Music]

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,800
the first rule of success is to have a

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,630
vision you see if you don't have a

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,180
vision of where you go and if you don't

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,330
have a goal where you go you drift

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,860
around and you never end up anywhere

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,400
it's like you can have the best ship in

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,930
the world

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,489
you can have the best airplane in the

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,750
world if the pilot or the captain

13
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:39,489
doesn't know where to go

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,170
it would just drift around they would

15
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:46,780
not end up anywhere almost like in the

16
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:50,230
wrong place so I was very fortunate did

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:53,170
I stumble on the my vision I mean as you

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:56,709
know I was born in 1947 in Austria after

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:00,430
the Second World War and I didn't really

20
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,920
like Austria when I grew up I couldn't

21
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:06,790
wait to get out of there I couldn't see

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,120
myself becoming a farmer or working in a

23
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,979
factory or anything like that even

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,549
though my parents wanted me to stay

25
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:17,350
there and have a normal life my father

26
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:20,350
wanted me to become a police officer

27
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:23,530
like he was my mother wanted me just to

28
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:28,030
stay there and marry a girl in the name

29
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:31,119
of Heidi hopefully and have a bunch of

30
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,810
kids and run around like the fun trap

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,899
family in the sound of music but that

32
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,490
was their vision not mine my vision was

33
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,960
totally different I felt that that was

34
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,869
born for something special for something

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,658
unique for something big do you know how

36
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:48,689
great it felt that I knew where I was

37
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:50,740
going

38
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,609
imagine the majority of people don't

39
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,289
know where they're going

40
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:56,990
it's when you have a goal when you have

41
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:59,780
a vision everything becomes easy

42
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:03,380
because remember that in America for

43
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,820
instance when you study you will see the

44
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,350
percentage of people did like their jobs

45
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,609
[Music]

46
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:15,290
74% hate their job in America

47
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,870
now this is not much different when you

48
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,780
come to Europe the majority of people

49
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,520
don't like what they're doing because

50
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,960
they're really not doing it because they

51
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,660
didn't have a goal and they'd followed

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,340
this goal they're just aimlessly drift

53
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,840
around and then over sudden if there's a

54
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,440
job opening so they get their job

55
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:38,600
because if the world but then when you

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:41,329
grow it's a chore it's work it's not fun

57
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,769
so if you think about only a quarter of

58
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,640
the people really enjoy what they're

59
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,440
doing in life that is unbelievable if

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,269
you think about it so I felt so blessed

61
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,120
that I knew what I was doing

62
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,100
it's like a medical students in studies

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,610
and knows he wants to become a doctor

64
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,430
you know where to go

65
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,030
so I know where to go so people always

66
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:07,210
ask me when they saw me in the gym in

67
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:10,570
the pumping iron days you say why is it

68
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:13,000
that you're working out so hard five

69
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:17,620
hours a day six hours a day and you have

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,300
always a smile on your face the others

71
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,920
are working out just as hard as you do

72
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,940
and then look sour

73
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,619
in the face why is that and they told

74
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,359
people all the time is it because to me

75
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:35,470
I am shooting for gold in front of mr.

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,450
mr. Universe title so every rep that I

77
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,180
do gets me closer to accomplishing that

78
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,920
goal to make this call this vision turn

79
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,180
into reality every single set that I do

80
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,549
every repetition every weight that the

81
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,910
lift will get my step closer to turned

82
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:54,850
his goal into reality so I couldn't wait

83
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,520
to do another 500 pound squat I couldn't

84
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,250
wait to another 500 pound bench press I

85
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,350
couldn't wait to do another 2,000 reps

86
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,440
of sit-ups I couldn't wait for the next

87
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,640
exercise for the next half hour posing

88
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,640
and all the kind of things that you have

89
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,690
to do you'll be a champion and with the

90
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,640
age of 20

91
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,950
with the age of 20 I went to London and

92
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,039
I won the Mr Universe contest as the

93
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:27,570
youngest mr. universe ever and it was

94
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:29,220
because I had a goal so let me tell you

95
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,490
something visualizing your goal and

96
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,380
going after it makes it fun you got to

97
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,680
have a purpose no matter what you do in

98
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,670
life you got to have a purpose so that's

99
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,080
rule number one

100
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:47,280
have a vision rule number two is don't

101
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:56,099
listen to the naysayers don't listen to

102
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:57,330
the naysayers everything I ever did the

103
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,020
thing that they heard out of people's

104
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,800
mouths was that's impossible that can't

105
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,169
be done

106
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:09,870
Oh No so whenever someone said to me it

107
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:13,859
can't be done I heard it can be done

108
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:16,200
when they say no I heard yes I mean they

109
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,990
said it's impossible I heard it is

110
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,620
possible I'm a strong believer what

111
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,390
Nelson Mandela said that everything is

112
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,830
always impossible until someone does it

113
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,390
well I'm gonna be the one that said to

114
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,010
myself I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna

115
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,590
show you to them maybe it has never been

116
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:38,849
done before that's perfectly fine with

117
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:41,630
me but I am gonna do it and I did not

118
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,630
listen to the naysayers

119
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,670
next thing the third point that I'm

120
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,890
gonna make to you is before we sit down

121
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:52,510
with your gun and talk about the rest of

122
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:56,320
the three is work your ass off there is

123
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:59,320
no magic bill there is no magic out

124
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,510
there you cannot get around you have to

125
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,219
work and work and work and it drives me

126
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:08,170
crazy when people say they don't have

127
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:11,200
enough time to go to the gym for 45

128
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:13,570
minutes a day and work out or do

129
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,300
something for 45 minutes to an hour they

130
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:20,290
do improve if it is physically improve

131
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:26,290
of it is mentally to improve imagine you

132
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:30,630
read one hour a day about history how

133
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:35,080
much you will learn after 365 hours in

134
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:37,300
one year think about if you study about

135
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,190
the history of musicians of composers

136
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,230
how much you would know

137
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,330
imagine if you who work on the business

138
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:47,050
and some business that you want to

139
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,760
develop every day for an hour

140
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:52,290
imagine how further along you will go

141
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,230
and get

142
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,420
so it drives me nuts because we have but

143
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,800
people said we don't have the time we

144
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:06,470
have 24 hours a day we sleep 6 hours a

145
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,150
day so that gives you still 18 hours

146
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,130
and there's someone shaking the head out

147
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,510
here in front to say probably I don't

148
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:16,510
sleep six hours i sleep eight hours

149
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,510
right but just sleep faster

150
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:24,050
[Applause]

151
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:32,919
so we have 18 hours a day the average

152
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:34,479
person works around 8 to 10 hours so

153
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,818
let's assume it's 10 hours so if you

154
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,878
have 8 hours left then you travel around

155
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:43,959
an hour a day maybe 2 hours a day

156
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:46,370
so now you've still 6 hours left so what

157
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,590
do you do with this 6 hours

158
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:52,540
where do we the six hours then we eat a

159
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,888
little bit and we schmooze a little bit

160
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,410
talk a little bit the people in ordered

161
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:02,570
stuff but you can see how much time 2 is

162
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:05,120
available if you organize your day so

163
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,389
you got to work hard I mean let me tell

164
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,860
you something when I went to America I

165
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:16,310
went to college I went and worked out 5

166
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,150
hours a day and I was working on

167
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:22,790
construction because in those days in

168
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,109
bodybuilding there was no money we

169
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,510
didn't I didn't have the money for food

170
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,210
supplements or anything so I had to go

171
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,729
to work so we worked in construction I

172
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,520
went to college I worked out in the gym

173
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:37,968
and at night from 8 o'clock at night to

174
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:42,169
12 midnight I went to acting class four

175
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:45,470
times a week say I did all that there

176
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:48,949
was not one single minute that I wasted

177
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:54,770
I became very friendly with Muhammad Ali

178
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:59,150
in the 70s Muhammad Ali worked his butt

179
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:01,939
off in a saw it firsthand now remember

180
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,310
that there was a sports rider that was

181
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,720
there in the gym when he was working out

182
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,939
and he was doing situps

183
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,480
and they asked him how many sit-ups do

184
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:15,620
you do and he said I don't start

185
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,839
counting until it hurts now think about

186
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,920
that he doesn't start counting his

187
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:25,279
sit-ups and bill Davy feels pain that's

188
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,640
when he starts counting that is working

189
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,209
hard and so you can't get around the

190
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,600
hardware it doesn't matter who it is so

191
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:39,219
maverick I believe what Ted Turner said

192
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,220
work like hell and advertise

193
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,700
you get it work like hell go to bed and

194
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,150
early early to rise work like hell and

195
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:55,790
advertise so you work your ass off and

196
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:59,000
then you let the world know about your

197
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:01,250
work that's what it is all about let

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,640
people know if you have a company if you

199
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,220
have a movie if you do a sports work

200
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:18,050
your ass off but then advertise and let

201
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:24,290
everyone know I hate plan B and I tell

202
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:26,990
you why because we have so many doubters

203
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:30,110
as I've said earlier they eat the no

204
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,480
sales we have so many of those people

205
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:36,560
did say no and you can't do it it's

206
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,980
impossible that is okay because we just

207
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,589
turn off as I said earlier and B listen

208
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,990
and be hear that now being a yes you

209
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:47,840
can't do it do it you can't do it and

210
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,240
all that so that that is possible to do

211
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,640
that amongst all the negative people

212
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,740
around you but when you start doubting

213
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,750
yourself that's very dangerous because

214
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,700
now what you're basically saying is is

215
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:09,460
that if my plan doesn't work

216
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:11,110
I have a fallback plan have a plan B if

217
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,690
that means that you start thinking about

218
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,900
Plan B and every thought that you put

219
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:22,920
into Plan B you're taking away now that

220
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,920
thought and that energy from plan a and

221
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:35,290
and it's very important to understand

222
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:39,070
that we function better if there is no

223
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:43,449
safety net because Plan B becomes a

224
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:45,880
safety net it says that if I fail then

225
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,010
fr and I get picked up and I have

226
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,520
something else there that was they will

227
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:54,250
protect me and that's not good because

228
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,939
people perform better when there is no

229
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:01,240
safety net people perform better in

230
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,720
sports and everything else if you don't

231
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,970
have a plan B to me it is very dangerous

232
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,510
to have a plan B because you're cutting

233
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,580
yourself off from the chance of really

234
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,380
succeeding and the reason one of the

235
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,380
main reasons why people want to have a

236
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,420
plan B is because they are worried about

237
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,070
failing

238
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,920
what is if I fail then I don't have

239
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,950
anything else well let me tell you

240
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,880
something don't be afraid of failing

241
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:31,750
because there's nothing wrong with

242
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,870
failing you have to fail in order to

243
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,260
climb that ladder there's no one that

244
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:43,290
doesn't fail

245
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:43,290
we all fail it's okay

246
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:54,959
what is not okay is that when you fail

247
00:12:50,399 --> 00:13:00,930
you stay down whoever stays down is a

248
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:03,839
loser and winners will fail and get up

249
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:08,729
fail and get up fail and get up you

250
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,410
always get up that is a winner that is a

251
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,980
winner

252
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:16,069
hey we all lose you all have lost us

253
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,899
this is okay and this is why I say don't

254
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:20,279
be worried about losing because when

255
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,879
you're afraid of losing then you get

256
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:26,399
frozen you get stiff you're not relaxed

257
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,529
you got to be in order to perform well

258
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,680
in anything if it's in boxing or if it

259
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:35,670
is on your job or with your thinking is

260
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:39,388
only happening when you relax so relax

261
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:41,279
it's okay to fail let's just go all out

262
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:43,829
and give it everything that you got

263
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,740
that's what it is all about so don't be

264
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:50,160
afraid to fail this is one of my six

265
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:53,940
rules to success you can only feel

266
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,150
complete as a person

267
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:01,770
if you think about what can you do for

268
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:04,050
your fellow member around you that maybe

269
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:06,150
needs help

270
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,579
I felt like that everyone has a

271
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:11,880
different motivation why you get into

272
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:15,270
that I was an immigrant going to America

273
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,710
and I saw how America was the most

274
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,270
generous country in the world I mean

275
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,620
they opened up their arms to me they

276
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,449
helped me they invited me for

277
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,180
Thanksgiving dinner the people they

278
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,640
brought me the bodybuilders in the gym

279
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,140
brought me plates to my apartment

280
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,770
because I had no plates had no

281
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,170
silverware

282
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:33,540
I had no bed where I had no pillows at

283
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:36,599
no blanket I had no TV I had no radio I

284
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,089
had nothing they brought it to my

285
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,670
apartment

286
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:44,730
they helped me that's all that firsthand

287
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,500
this generosity in America in the city

288
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,530
myself as an immigrant that is being

289
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,780
embraced with open arms that I need to

290
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,900
go and make sure that I give something

291
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,900
back

292
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,210
